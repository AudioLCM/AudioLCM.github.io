This is a bluegrass music piece. There is a mandolin playing the main tune as the lead while a banjo and an acoustic guitar are supporting it in the melodic background. There is a joyful feeling to this piece. It could be used in the soundtrack of a movie or a TV show with a rural setting. It could also be used in the background of pastoral social media content.
